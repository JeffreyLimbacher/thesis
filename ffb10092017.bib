with $O(MN)$ operations, where $N$ is the number of the discrete velocity points and $M<N$. The algorithm 
uses nodal-discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the collision operator on uniform grids and a bilinear 
convolution form of the Galerkin projection of the collision operator. Efficiency of the algorithms is achieved 
by applying singular value decomposition compression of the discrete collision kernel and by approximating the kinetic 
solution by a sum of Maxwellian streams using a stochastic likelihood maximization algorithm. Accuracy of the 
method is established on solutions to the problem of spatially 
homogeneous relaxation. "

abstract = "Abstract The Boltzmann equation describes the dynamics of rarefied gas flows, but the multidimensional nature of its collision operator poses a real challenge for its numerical solution. In this paper, the fast spectral method [36], originally developed by Mouhot and Pareschi for the numerical approximation of the collision operator, is extended to deal with other collision kernels, such as those corresponding to the soft, Lennard–Jones, and rigid attracting potentials. The accuracy of the fast spectral method is checked by comparing our numerical solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation with the exact Bobylev–Krook–Wu solutions for a gas of Maxwell molecules. It is found that the accuracy is improved by replacing the trapezoidal rule with Gauss–Legendre quadrature in the calculation of the kernel mode, and the conservation of momentum and energy are ensured by the Lagrangian multiplier method without loss of spectral accuracy. The relax-to-equilibrium processes of different collision kernels with the same value of shear viscosity are then compared; the numerical results indicate that different forms of the collision kernels can be used as long as the shear viscosity (not only the value, but also its temperature dependence) is recovered. An iteration scheme is employed to obtain stationary solutions of the space-inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation, where the numerical errors decay exponentially. Four classical benchmarking problems are investigated: the normal shock wave, and the planar Fourier/Couette/force-driven Poiseuille flows. For normal shock waves, our numerical results are compared with a finite difference solution of the Boltzmann equation for hard sphere molecules, experimental data, and molecular dynamics simulation of argon using the realistic Lennard–Jones potential. For planar Fourier/Couette/force-driven Poiseuille flows, our results are compared with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Excellent agreements are observed in all test cases, demonstrating the merit of the fast spectral method as a computationally efficient method for rarefied gas dynamics. "

abstract = "Abstract Although the fast spectral method has been established for solving the Boltzmann equation for single-species monatomic gases, its extension to gas mixtures is not easy because of the non-unitary mass ratio between the different molecular species. The conventional spectral method can solve the Boltzmann collision operator for binary gas mixtures but with a computational cost of the order m r 3 N 6 , where m r is the mass ratio of the heavier to the lighter species, and N is the number of frequency nodes in each frequency direction. In this paper, we propose a fast spectral method for binary mixtures of monatomic gases that has a computational cost O ( m r M 2 N 4 log ⁡ N ) , where M 2 is the number of discrete solid angles. The algorithm is validated by comparing numerical results with analytical Bobylev–Krook–Wu solutions for the spatially-homogeneous relaxation problem, for m r up to 36. In spatially-inhomogeneous problems, such as normal shock waves and planar Fourier/Couette flows, our results compare well with those of both the numerical kernel and the direct simulation Monte Carlo methods. As an application, a two-dimensional temperature-driven flow is investigated, for which other numerical methods find it difficult to resolve the flow field at large Knudsen numbers. The fast spectral method is accurate and effective in simulating highly rarefied gas flows, i.e. it captures the discontinuities and fine structures in the velocity distribution functions. "

abstract = "A consistent approach for generating a hybrid DSMC/CFD solution is presented for re-entry applications involving neutral gas mixtures with internal energy. A quality hybrid solution requires consistency in the thermo-chemical models employed by the particle (DSMC) and continuum (CFD) solvers, as well as an appropriate boundary condition for the transfer of flux information across the hybrid interface. The first half of this work focuses on achieving consistency in the transport properties obtained by particle and continuum solvers, including species diffusion, viscosity and translational and internal thermal conductivities for a five-species air mixture. In the second portion, a new approach for the generation of particles at a hybrid interface is presented for gas mixtures with internal degrees of freedom. Particle thermal velocities and internal energies are prescribed from the appropriate non-equilibrium (perturbed) distribution, in which diffusion, shear stress and heat flux terms are included in the Generalized Chapman-Enskog formulation of the perturbation. The significance of the contributions from these terms on the perturbation are examined at a hybrid interface within non-equilibrium boundary layer flow, as well as within the breakdown region near a normal shock, in a five-species air gas mixture. The validity of the Chapman-Enskog perturbation at each of these hybrid interfaces is assessed by comparison with the Generalized Chapman-Enskog perturbations."

     abstract = {The development of accurate and fast numerical schemes for the five-fold Boltzmann collision integral represents a challenging problem in scientific computing. For a particular class of interactions, including the so-called hard spheres model in dimension three, we are able to derive spectral methods that can be evaluated through fast algorithms. These algorithms are based on a suitable representation and approximation of the collision operator. Explicit expressions for the errors in the schemes are given and spectral accuracy is proved. Parallelization properties and adaptivity of the algorithms are also discussed.},
